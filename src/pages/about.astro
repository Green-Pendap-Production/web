                    Green Pendap Production started with a simple idea: games
                    should be more than just entertainment—they should be
                    experiences that stick with you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Founded in 2024, our studio brings together a diverse team
                    of artists, programmers, and storytellers who share a
                    passion for creating unique worlds. We believe in the power
                    of interactive storytelling and the joy of well-crafted
                    mechanics.
                </p>

                    Our Philosophy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't just make games; we craft experiences. Every pixel,
                    every line of dialogue, and every sound effect is carefully
                    considered to immerse player in our worlds. We value
                    creativity over trends and player experience over
                    monetization.
                </p>
